    <h2>List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Programmers work at night because it doesn't impose a time limit on when you have to stop working, which gives you a more relaxed approach. Your brain doesn't keep looking for distractions, and a bright screen keeps you awake.</li>
        <li>Night time programming offers a much better work environment in 95% of cases. No matter what efforts you make to create an ideal work environment during the day you will likely never succeed to the extent it would equal a night time situation.</li>
        <li>While it might save you a tiny amount of power and, if you are using it at night, marginally help your sleep schedule, these benefits don't seem to be that substantial. In addition, reading dark text on a light background may help you read and write code more efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>List</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Most developers starve and are thirsty for knowledge and for learning new things. That makes coding so addictive. You're growing your skills every time. Your perspective and designing system knowledge make you a better you every time, even in your daily personal life, such as planning and efficiency.</li>
        <li>Most programmers are primarily single because of their age, gender, and workload. 72% of programmers are under the age of 35 and 91% of them are male. Younger men are more likely to be single with 39% of them not having a partner. Plus the workload of a programmer can sometimes make it harder to meet a partner.</li>
        <li>Now, let's focus on some concrete things you can do to move toward a better night's sleep, which will help you product your best code: Please sleep at least 7 to 8 hours, though the amount of sleep you need depends on your body.</li>
    </ol>
